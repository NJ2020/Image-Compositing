# Image-Compositing
End-to-end Deep learning model which can generate aesthetically pleasing, photorealistic composite by combining two (or more) selfies.
Code to generate a custom dataset for Image compositing using COCO segmented data along with techniques borrowed from the field of Image processing.
A Model trained in the unsupervised setting to make it learn the perception of visual realism, which was further deployed to filter less visually pleasing composites.
